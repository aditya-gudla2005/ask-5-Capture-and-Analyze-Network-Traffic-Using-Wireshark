# Task 5 â€“ Network Packet Capture and Analysis

## Objective:
To capture and analyze real-time network traffic using Wireshark, and identify different network protocols in the data.

## Tools Used:
- Wireshark (Network analyzer)
- Kali Linux 

## What I Did:
1. Opened Wireshark and selected the active network interface
2. Captured live traffic for about 1 minute while generating traffic (e.g., browsing, pinging)
3. Saved the capture as `packanalysis.pcapng`
4. Filtered and identified protocol packets
   - DNS
   - TCP
   - ICMP
5. Documented the findings in a summary report

## Files Included:
- `packanalysis.pcapng`: Packet capture file
- `protocol_summary.md`: Description of identified protocols

## Outcome:
This task gave me practical exposure to analyzing live network communication and understanding protocol-level behavior using Wireshark.
