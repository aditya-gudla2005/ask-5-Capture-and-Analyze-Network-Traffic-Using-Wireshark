# Protocol Summary â€“ Task 5

## Protocols Identified from Capture:

1. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**  
Used to carry HTTP, HTTPS, and other reliable communications between devices. Multiple TCP segments were observed in the capture.

2. **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**  
Used for diagnostics such as `ping`. ICMP Echo Requests and Echo Replies were captured.

3. **DNS (Domain Name System)**  
Used to resolve domain names to IP addresses. DNS query and response packets are visible.

## What I Learned:
- How to use Wireshark to capture live traffic
- How to identify protocol behavior at the packet level
- The role of DNS, ICMP, and TCP in regular internet communication
